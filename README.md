# House Price Prediction Using XGBoost and Regression Models

## Description / Overview

This project explores the prediction of house sale prices using different regression models. Using a real estate dataset, the team performed data cleaning, outlier removal, feature engineering, and tested various models including XGBoost, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Ridge Regression. The goal was to find a robust model that minimizes overfitting and predicts prices accurately.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
   cd <YOUR_REPO_DIRECTORY>
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:  
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib xgboost scipy statsmodels
   ```

## Usage

- Load the dataset `house_sales.csv`.
- Use Python scripts or notebooks to:
  - Perform EDA and visualize outliers, correlations, and feature distributions.
  - Clean the data, handle missing values, remove outliers.
  - Select features and perform transformations.
  - Train regression models:
    - XGBoost
    - Linear Regression
    - Random Forest Regressor
    - Ridge Regression
  - Evaluate models using RÂ², RMSE, MAE, and cross-validation.
  - Analyze feature importance.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis with correlation matrices, boxplots, and histograms.
- Data cleaning with outlier detection and removal.
- Log transformations for skewed features.
- XGBoost model tuning and cross-validation.
- Comparison of multiple regression models.
- Feature importance visualization.
